### Historical notes:

- *In every annual report, Jeff Bezos attaches his [1997 Letter to Shareholders](https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/annual/Shareholderletter97.pdf), that layed the foundation of some of the principles.*
- *It's said, that [in 1998 he and his colleagues agreed on the core principles](https://medium.com/fact-of-the-day-1/the-origins-of-leadership-principles-f42f3ed601a) and wrote them down on a whiteboard.*
- *In 2015 Amazon introduced "Learn and Be Curious"*.
- *On Jul 1, 2021 Amazon introduced "Strive to be Earth's Best Employer" and "Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility". They were added just before Jeff Bezos stepped down as CEO and passed the role to Andy Jassy (Jul 5).*

## How to use / benchmark yourself TODO

## Principles

### Customer Obsession

The principle prioritizes focusing on the customers' needs long-term and earning their trust.
Ideally, you should: 
- Understand who your customer is, their needs, and what they truly expect from you (beyond specific tasks).
- Focus on addressing those needs and pain points, not just completing tasks.

### Ownership

The principle encourages employees to take ownership, rather than waiting for direction from management. 
Ideally, you should:
- Take ownership for your ideas and initiatives.
- Take responsibility, if something goes wrong (be accountable).
- Never say "That's not my job".

### Invent and Simplify

The principle states, that leaders expect innovation (creating new things at Amazon) and advocate for simple solutions, because they are easier and cheaper to build and maintain.
Ideally, you should:
- Look for new ideas (innovation). Do not adhere to [NIH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here).
- Simplify the existing processes (simplification).
- Be ready to be misunderstood.

### Are Right, A Lot

This principle is not about being right all the time, but about developing intuition to be as right as possible at the time that a decision is needed. It's also about being open to being wrong.
Ideally, you should:
- Know when to move forward without deeply investigating every detail, or freely escalating to leadership when a more careful and thorough approach is required.
- Be open to reassessing your viewpoint and alternative perspectives ("seek perspective and work on disconfirming your beliefs").
